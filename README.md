## About Me
I'm Collin, a Mechanical Engineering student at Liberty University. I specialize in mechanical d
<br>As someone who is highly interested in Engineering I also like to have some hobbies. Some of these hobbies include hiking, camping, and running. I am a very active person having done some pretty cool backpacking trips and I've trained for marathons as well.

## Engineering Interests
I am studying mechanical engineering but I have a deep interest in energetics including aerospace propulsion systems and high performance automotive propulsion. In the focus of my career I think I would fit best as a Mechanical Design Engineer in the Aerospace or Automotive industry.
<br>I seem to have backed this up with my involvment in my university's Rocketry Propulsion team and NASA internship. You can find more information within My Projects.
<br>I am always tinkering on something wether it be a specific engineering project or a personal project. I own an old 90's Volkswagen that I fix and tune myself and from this I have gained a lot of mechanical know-how.
