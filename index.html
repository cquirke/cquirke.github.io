  <div class="about-text">

    <p>
      I’m Collin, a Mechanical Engineering student at Liberty University with a strong focus on mechanical
      design, structural analysis, and propulsion systems. My academic and project experience centers on
      aerospace and high-performance mechanical systems, particularly solid rocket motors, UAV platforms,
      and propulsion-related hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of engineering, I stay highly active and enjoy hiking, camping, and endurance training. I’ve
      completed several backpacking trips and trained for long-distance races, which reflects my disciplined
      mindset and long-term goal-oriented approach. I bring that same persistence and attention to detail
      into my engineering work.

  <h2>Engineering Interests</h2>

  <p>
    While I am pursuing Mechanical Engineering, my primary interests lie in <strong>energetics and
    propulsion systems</strong>, especially within aerospace applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    My experience includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Solid rocket motor design and static fire testing</li>
    <li>UAV structural and mission design</li>
    <li>Rocket propulsion team involvement</li>
    <li>NASA internship exposure</li>
    <li>Mechanical fabrication and testing</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I’m particularly interested in mechanical design roles where I can contribute to aerospace vehicles,
    propulsion hardware, and advanced mechanical systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of school projects, I’m always working on something hands-on — whether it’s a new engineering
    concept, a personal fabrication project, or tuning and maintaining my 1990s Volkswagen. This has helped
    me develop strong mechanical intuition and real-world problem-solving skills.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Highlights</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prototype1_SRM</strong> – Solid Rocket Motor Design & Static Fire</li>
    <li><strong>UAV Design Challenge 2024</strong> – Competition UAV System</li>
